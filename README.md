# DSLR: Logistic Regression for Hogwarts House Classification

This project is part of the 42 school curriculum and demonstrates the use of logistic regression to classify individuals into their Hogwarts houses.

## Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Build a logistic regression model that predicts the Hogwarts house based on a set of features.

- **Key Features:**  
  - Data preprocessing and descriptive statistics  
  - Visualizations including pair plots, scatter plots, and histograms  
  - Model training, prediction, and evaluation  
  - Generation of statistical insights and predictions


## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FastaLaPasta/DSLR.git
    cd DSLR
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure Python 3 is installed and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Datasets:**
    Verify that the required CSV files are present in the `datasets` folder.

## Usage

- **Data Analysis:**  
  Run `describes.py` to generate descriptive statistics of the dataset.

- **Model Training:**  
  Execute `logreg_train.py` to train the logistic regression model.

- **Prediction:**  
  Use `logreg_predict.py` to generate predictions for the test dataset.

- **Visualization:**  
  Generate plots by running `pair_plot.py`, `scatter_plot.py`, and `histogram.py`.

## Challenges & Learnings

- Data preprocessing and feature scaling  
- Model implementation and parameter tuning  
- Effective visualization of multi-dimensional data
